# Data-Analysis-on-CO2-Emission
This is a Guru99 live python project on CO2 Emission for different countries

Steps taken in this project
1. We read the CSV File and stored the data in a dictionary
2. We took a year input from the user which we used to calculate the min, max and average.
3. Next we took a country input from the user, extracted the year and printed some information about it.
4. Then we visualized the data. Plotted the emissions data from a user-selected country using Python plotting library matplotlib.
5. Next we compared the country data using a graph based on user input.
6. Finally, we extract data for up to three user-selected countries and saved it to a new file Emissions_subset.csv.
